# Lab1---Sopongco
This repository contains Lab 1 activities focused on understanding software development standards, essential development tools, and the basics of version control using Git and GitHub.

Software development standards are a set of guidelines, best practices, and conventions that developers follow when creating software. These standards ensure that code is readable, consistent, maintainable, and reliable across different developers and teams. By following software development standards, projects become easier to debug, enhance, and scale, while also reducing errors and misunderstandings during collaboration. Standards are important because they promote quality, efficiency, and professionalism in software development, especially in team-based projects.

Several tools are commonly used in software development to improve productivity and code quality. One important tool is Git, a version control system that tracks changes in source code and allows developers to manage different versions of a project. Another widely used tool is GitHub, an online platform that hosts Git repositories and supports collaboration, code sharing, and project management. Additionally, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code help developers write, debug, and test code efficiently by providing features like syntax highlighting, extensions, and debugging tools.

Version control systems play a crucial role in software projects by allowing developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate without overwriting each other’s work. Using version control makes teamwork more organized and secure, as each change is documented and attributed to a contributor. It also helps in identifying bugs, managing updates, and maintaining a clear history of the project’s development, making it an essential part of modern software engineering.
